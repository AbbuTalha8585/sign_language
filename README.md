# Sign Language Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Sign Language Recognition System** that translates sign language gestures into text using computer vision and deep learning. It helps bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time sign language detection
- Supports ASL (American Sign Language) / Custom Sign Language Dataset
- Deep learning model (CNN/LSTM-based)
- Web-based / Desktop GUI implementation
- Live camera support
- Gesture-based word prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch / OpenCV
- **Database:** MySQL / Firebase (if applicable)
- **Tools & Libraries:** OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 🏗️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
